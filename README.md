To view this project, first download or clone the repository to your PC.  The program will run from the `entertainment_center.py` file.  Open `entertainment_center.py` in Python's IDLE and run the module.

### What to expect

When your run the `entertainment_center.py` module, it will open a web browser that displays the "Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer" website.  That site lists a few of my favorite movies with their poster image and a brief description about the storyline.  If you select a movie, the movie trailer will play.
